# Milestones Extension

The `MilestonesExtension` contract is designed for managing milestones within a funding strategy. It supports setting, submitting, and reviewing milestones, allowing for structured progress tracking and funding disbursement.

## Key Features

- `submitUpcomingMilestone(address _recipientId, Metadata calldata _metadata)`: Allows recipients to submit a milestone for review.
- `reviewMilestone(MilestoneStatus _milestoneStatus)`: Reviews and updates the status of the submitted milestone.
- `increaseMaxBid(uint256 _maxBid)`: Updates the maximum allowable bid.

## Events

- `MilestonesSet(uint256 milestonesLength)`: Emitted when milestones are set.
- `MilestoneSubmitted(uint256 milestoneId)`: Emitted when a milestone is submitted.
- `MilestoneStatusChanged(uint256 milestoneId, MilestoneStatus newStatus)`: Emitted when a milestoneâ€™s status is changed.
- `SetBid(address bidderId, uint256 bidAmount)`: Emitted when a bid is set.
